# Frequently asked questions

### What can a modded console do?

*   Run homebrew applications, such as emulators and cheat engines
*   Stream games from your PC
*   Play game backups
*   Overclocking
*   Use controllers from other consoles, such as PS5 and Xbox Series S/X controllers
*   Dual boot to Android to run Android apps and games

### Can I still play online or will my console get banned?

There's always a risk using a modified console that you will be banned if you use it to play online, and there is no way to 100% prevent it from happening. However there are ways to make it _less_ likely (emummc, incognito), but setting that up is outside of the scope of what I do with a standard install
