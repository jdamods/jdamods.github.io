Postage for installs or complete consoles is $20

⚠️ Payment by cash or PayID only. Nothing will be sent until full payment is received.

# What is the process?

* Send me a message on Facebook Marketplace or Instagram to confirm pricing and where to post

* Post the console, and include an SD card if you want me to set it up. You don't need to send any accessories (joy cons, charger, etc), just the console itself

* Once received, I usually complete the installation on the same day. I'll keep you updated on when I receive it, and send some pictures of the completed install to confirm everything is working

* I will post back within the next 1-2 days (most likely next day) and provide a tracking number

* Once you've received the console back and turn it on, you won't get the usual "Nintendo" boot screen, but instead you'll be in the [Hekate bootloader](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate).

  From here, you can either jump straight into custom firmware by launching the "sysmmc" option in the "Launch" menu, or you can create an emummc partition so you can dual boot between official and custom firmware

### Post install tips

* Boot into offical firmware
  * power on while holding Vol+
  * From the bootloader/Hekate screen, select **Reboot** and then **OFW**

* To open the homebrew menu:
  * Full mode - Start any game while holding the R button
  * Applet mode - Open **Album** on the home screen
    * If you want to open the actual album and not the homebrew menu, open it while holding R

* To check your custom firmware version, from the Switch home screen go to **System Settings** > **System**, where you'll find the current firmware and Atmosphere version numbers

# Frequently asked questions

### What can a modded console do?

*   Run homebrew applications, such as emulators, save editors, cheat engines, and much more
*   Stream games from your PC
*   Play game backups
*   Overclocking CPU/GPU/RAM
*   Use controllers from other consoles, such as PS5 and Xbox Series S/X controllers
*   Dual boot to Android to run Android apps and games

### Can I still play online or will my console get banned?

There's always a risk using a modified console that you will be banned if you use it to play online, and there is no way to 100% prevent it from happening. However there are ways to make it _less_ likely (emummc, incognito), but setting that up is outside of the scope of what I do with a standard install

### How do I know I'm not going to get scammed?

You don't, I'm just some guy on the internet saying you should send your several hundred dollar gaming console to me. Unfortunately there's no good way for me to prove that I won't do that, but... I won't do that. The only "proof" I can offer is that my eBay profile (linked below) has plenty of positive feedback.
