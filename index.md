# What is the process?

* Post the console to me. You don't need to send any accessories (joy cons, charger, etc), but you **will** need to send your SD card if you'd like me to set it up

* Once received, I usually complete the install on the same day

* If payment has been received, I try to have the console sent back the next day. Sometimes life gets in the way and it might take an extra day for me to get to a post office, but I'll keep you updated throughout the whole process

* Once you've received the console back and turn it on, you won't get the usual "Nintendo" boot screen, but instead you'll be in the [Hekate bootloader](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate). From here, you can either jump straight into custom firmware by launching sysmmc in the "Launch" menu, or you can create an emummc partition so you can dual boot between official and custom firmware

# Frequently asked questions

### What can a modded console do?

*   Run homebrew applications, such as emulators, save editors, cheat engines, and much more
*   Stream games from your PC
*   Play game backups
*   Overclocking CPU/GPU/RAM
*   Use controllers from other consoles, such as PS5 and Xbox Series S/X controllers
*   Dual boot to Android to run Android apps and games

### Can I still play online or will my console get banned?

There's always a risk using a modified console that you will be banned if you use it to play online, and there is no way to 100% prevent it from happening. However there are ways to make it _less_ likely (emummc, incognito), but setting that up is outside of the scope of what I do with a standard install

### How do I know I'm not going to get scammed?

You don't, I'm just some guy on the internet saying you should send your several hundred dollar gaming console to me. Unfortunately there's no good way for me to prove that I won't do that, but... I won't do that. I guess the only "proof" I can offer is that my eBay profile (linked below) has plenty of positive feedback.
